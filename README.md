# Population Growth in Animal Farming: A Verhulst Model Approach

Project for the course *Fundamentals of Mathematical Modeling* at the Faculty of Mathematics.

## Overview

This project examines animal population growth in farming using the Verhulst logistic model, which accounts for limited natural resources. We derive and solve the model, explore its dimensionless form, and apply it to a real-world example in animal farming, illustrating how it helps predict sustainable population sizes.

## Sections

1. **Introduction**: Problem overview and model relevance.
2. **Verhulst Logistic Model**: Derivation, solution, and dimensionless form.
3. **Application**: Real-world use in farming to manage population limits.
